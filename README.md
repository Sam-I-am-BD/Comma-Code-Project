# Comma-Code-Project
## Unpack a list into a string and add comma, spaces, as well as an "and" before the last item of the list.
This is the first project in chapter 4 from the book: Automate the boring stuff. Writing this code was fun and I appreciate that (this time) the author stated the problem clearly and without ambiguity.
